			<dd>Served over squash and a chunky, 
				mushroom-tomato sauce, these tender meatballs are tops when it comes to great flavor </dd> 
				<ul>Ingredients
					<li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
					<li>1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
					<li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
					<li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
					<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
					<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
					<li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
					<li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
					<li>1 medium spaghetti squash</li>
					<li>1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
					<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
					<li>1 can (14-1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
					<li>1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
					<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
					</ul>		
					<ol>
						Procedure
						<li>In a large bowl, 
							combine the first eight ingredients. Crumble chicken over mixture 
							and mix well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls.</li>
							<li>Place meatballs on a rack in a shallow baking pan.
								 Bake, uncovered, at 400Â° for 20-25 minutes or until 
								 no longer pink. Meanwhile, cut squash in half lengthwise; 
								 discard seeds. Place squash cut side down on a microwave-safe plate. 
								 Microwave, uncovered, on high for 15-18 minutes or until tender.</li>
						<li>For sauce, in a large nonstick skillet, saute mushrooms in oil until tender. 
							Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, 
							uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Add meatballs and heat through.</li>	
						<li>When squash is cool enough to handle, use a fork to separate strands. Serve with 
							meatballs and sauce.Freeze option: Place individual portions of cooled 
							meatballs and squash in freezer containers. To use, partially thaw in 
							refrigerator overnight. Microwave, covered, on high in a microwave-safe dish 
							until heated through, gently stirring and adding a little water if necessary.</li>

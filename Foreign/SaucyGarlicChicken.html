			<dd>Roasted garlic lends a rich flavor to this appetizing chicken entree, 
				and it complements the spinach nicely. Ideal for entertaining, the recipe 
				can be assembled in advance and popped in the oven when guests arrive. </dd>
				<ul>
					Ingredients
					<li>4 whole garlic bulbs</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
					<li>1 package (9 ounces) fresh baby spinach</li>
					<li>3/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
					<li>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper, divided</li>
					<li>6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (6 ounces each)</li>
					<li>6 tablespoons butter, cubed</li>
					<li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
					<li>3 cups 2% milk</li>
					<li>2-1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
					<li>1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
					<li>Hot cooked pasta</li>
					<li>Chopped tomato and minced fresh parsley, optional</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ol>Procedure
					<li>Remove papery outer skin from garlic (do not peel or separate cloves). 
						Cut tops off of garlic bulbs; brush bulbs with 1 tablespoon oil. Wrap 
						each bulb in heavy-duty foil. Bake at 425° for 30-35 minutes or until 
						softened. Cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Meanwhile, place spinach in a greased 13x9-in. baking dish; 
						sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. In a large skillet, 
						brown chicken in remaining oil on both sides; place over spinach.</li>	
					<li>In a large saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour until smooth; 
						gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes
						 or until thickened. Stir in 2 cups cheese, nutmeg and remaining salt and pepper.</li>	
					<li>Transfer to a blender; squeeze softened garlic into blender. 
						Cover and process until smooth. Pour mixture over chicken.</li>	
					<li><strong>Freeze option:</strong> Substitute 5 ounces frozen chopped
						 spinach that has been thawed and squeezed dry for fresh spinach. 
						 Cool unbaked casserole and sprinkle with remaining cheese; cover 
						 and freeze. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Remove 
						 from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 425°. Bake 
						 casserole as directed, increasing time as necessary to heat through and 
						 for a thermometer inserted in chicken to read 170°.</li>
